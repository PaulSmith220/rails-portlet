Rails-portlet repository
========================
This repository contains tools to run a webapp, operable within a JSR286 Java portlet.
The tools and configuration though is fine-tuned for Liferay and Rails co-operaation. 

This is the top level container for the submodules and the example. The example Rails application contains [the web page](http://rails-portlet.rubyforge.org/), and the functionality to deploy the application into a JSR286 container.

This needs a better explanation ...

To run the example Rails app, clone the repository and `cd rails-portlet/example && ./script/server`
