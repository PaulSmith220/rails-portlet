If you want Liferay database integration, you need the lportal gem.
Versions 1.0 and 1.1 do not offer MySQL support, and they only work on PostgreSQL.

If you are working with PostgreSQL database server, or are interested in 
developing MySQL support, install lportal by

  a) gem install lportal

	and add

		require 'lportal'

	to config/initializers/lportal.rb


  b) use the development library from git:

	git clone gitosis@rubyforge.org:lportal.git
