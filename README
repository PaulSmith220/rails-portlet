Rails-portlet makes any webapp, not just Ruby on Rails, presentable in a standard JSR286 Java portlet.
The tools and configuration though is fine-tuned for Liferay and Rails co-operaation. 

This is the top level container for the submodules and the examples.

Please hold on for the example, meanwhile you can find it from the Rubyforge repository
